FoxTreeKids

A Single Page Web Application for a Montessori School, allowing the school to engage with prospective and current parents in meaningful ways.

The main business goal of Fox Tree Kids Montessori School is to increase the number of children that are accepted onto their schooling program and to retain these pupils. To support this goal, the school needs to achieve three main objectives:

To attract as many prospective parents as possible to join their waiting list; supporting a steady, increasing flow of children entering their classes.
To attract as many prospective parents, who are not yet 100% sure they wish to apply to join the waiting list, to come and visit the school and meet the teachers - in order to hopefully lead to them ultimately joining the waiting list.
To ensure that current parents have a high rate of keeping their children in the school, throughout the entire 3 year cycle - 2.5 years to 6 years, as many families often choose to put their children into mainstream schooling and out of Montessori education at around 4.5 years.
Therefore this website is designed to call the prospective parents to two actions (either join the waiting list, or if not, at least schedule a visit), whilst ensuring that current parents feel the warmth of the school environment through its website and supporting their easy navigation toward any information they need in order to continue to justify keeping their child at Fox Tree Kids.

This Web Application was built with React.js, migrated to Next.js, made extensive use of Material UI and various npm packages.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
